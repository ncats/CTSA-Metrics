List of LOINCs, CPT, HCPCS, ICD9, ICD10 and RXNORM codes .
These lists were roughly unions of UPitt and UKY Top 50 codes. 
Added the Visit related CPTs even though they weren't in either list as they are important codes we may want to encourage sites to track down.
NDCs were left out given OMOP maps those to RXNORMS as well. We can discuss if that was appropriate.
