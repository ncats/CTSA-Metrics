/*
Notes:
1. The added "WITH st" clause allows to limit the data retrieval to after cut-off date, here set to the "beginning of time", 
   January 1, 1950.
   To change to your site requirements, just change date literal in st definition.
2. Suggested changes to the presentation of the data are included into individual sectioins, along with comments on 
   what to use to have the original presentation.
3. The query assumes that it is run in schema where OMOP tables are present.
4. The query assumes that OMOP dictionaries are under different schema, here called "omop".
5. The query is developed and tested on CDRN OMOP common data model (CDM); the differences from standard 
   OMOP CDM are indicated in comments to specific section, along with instructions on how to modify 
   the query to use on standard OMOP CDM.
